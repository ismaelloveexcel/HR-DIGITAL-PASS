I have a full-stack TypeScript project (React/Vite frontend, Express backend) for digital HR passes.
The current version covers all core UI and structure, but the following feature gaps need to be addressed:

Requirements:

Live Interview Slot Sync:

Make interview slot selection real-time across multiple users.

When a candidate selects or updates a slot, all relevant users (candidates/managers) see the update immediately (WebSocket, or polling as fallback).

Automation Toggles (Admin/Toolbar):

Connect the existing automation toggles (Timeline, Documents, Availability, Broadcast) in the admin toolbar to backend endpoints.

Changes to automations should persist and be reflected in all active user sessions.

Milestone Reminders & Notifications:

Implement backend logic for scheduled reminders (email, push, or in-app) before next interview or milestone.

When an event is coming up, send a notification automatically based on the schedule set in the pass.

Admin Actions:

Make admin actions (like batch onboarding, live broadcast, etc.) fully functional.

All changes made by admin/toolkit should reflect immediately for affected users.

README:

Add a README with:

How to install/run locally and on Replit

How to configure env variables (for notifications, DB, etc.)

How to trigger/test all new features

Stack/Constraints:

Use existing project structure (/client, /server, /shared).

Can use a lightweight DB (e.g., SQLite, Supabase, or Replit DB) if needed.

For notifications, if you can’t use email/SMS on Replit, implement in-app toasts or banners as fallback.

No need to change visuals, just complete the feature logic.

Checklist (deliverables):

 Real-time slot selection

 Persisted automation toggles

 Scheduled reminders/notifications

 Working admin actions

 Updated README

Output:
The updated project should work end-to-end with all features above—on Replit or local.
If any Replit limitation blocks external notifications, document the workaround and use in-app messaging instead.
